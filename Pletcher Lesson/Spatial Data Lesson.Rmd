## **Analysis of Spatial Point Patterns**

##### With much help from [Use R: Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7618-4) by Roger S. Bivand, Edzer Pebesma, Virgilio Gomez-Rubio

[whole script](Spatial Script 2.R) just in case

#### This is mainly to visualize and analyze spatial data to determine if it is uniform, clustered, or randomly spaced.

#### There's way more in-depth ways to analyze patterns in spatial and/or temporal data, but this is a way to begin to see if there is a pattern in spatial data at both large and small scales.

We will be using data on spatial distributions of Japanese Pine, Redwood saplings, and locations of cell centers.

```
data("japanesepines")
data("redwoodfull")
data("cells")

```
**1. Standardizing and visualizing Spatial Data**

We can look at the plots for each of these basic point pattern data sets

```
plot(japanesepines, main = "Japanese Pines", axes = TRUE)
plot(redwoodfull, main = "redwood", axes = TRUE)
plot(cells, main = "cells", axes = TRUE)

```
![1](japanesepines.png){width=40%}, ![2](redwoodfull.png){width=40%} ![3](cells.png){width=40%}


These are point pattern data sets, or in `ppp` format aka "cartesian corrdinates of points in a two-dimensional plane"

we need the the points in a format that can be used by `SpatStat` and can include more information about each point

We need to convert to `SpatialPoints`

```
spjpines <- as(japanesepines, "SpatialPoints")
spred <- as(redwoodfull, "SpatialPoints")
spcells <- as(cells, "SpatialPoints")

```
`SpatialPoints` returns data to its original scale

However, these are not directly comparable

```
plot(spjpines, main = "japanese pines", axes = TRUE)
plot(spred, main = "redwood", axes = TRUE)
plot(spcells, main = "cells", axes = TRUE)

summary(spjpines)#max of 5.7
summary(spred)#max of 1
summary(spcells)#max of 1

```
The Japanese pines have a max x axis of 5.7

Thankfully, we can use the `elide` method for standardizing `SpatialPoints` scales
```
spjpines1 <- elide(spjpines, scale=TRUE, unitsq=TRUE)
summary(spjpines1)#now the max = 1
```
Now we can set up a comparable data frame

```
dpp<-data.frame(rbind(coordinates(spjpines1),coordinates(spred), 
                      coordinates(spcells)))
print(dpp)
```
However, we need it to differentiate between the 3 different categories

```
njap<-nrow(coordinates(spjpines1))
nred<-nrow(coordinates(spred))
ncells<-nrow(coordinates(spcells))

dpp<-cbind(dpp,c(rep("JAPANESE",njap), rep("REDWOOD", nred), rep("CELLS", ncells))) 
names(dpp)<-c("x", "y", "DATASET")

print(dpp)
```
Now we can look at the standardized data as a whole

```
print(xyplot(y~x|DATASET, data=dpp, pch=19, aspect=1))
```
Correct standardized plots
![triple plot](triple plot.png){width=50%}

**if we didn't standardize the spacing of the Japanese pines,** 

*we would have gotten this*
![incorrect plots](wrong triple plot.png){width=50%}

From the looks of it, redwood trees seem clustered in a few places, cells seem spaced evenly, and pines seem possibly random...
